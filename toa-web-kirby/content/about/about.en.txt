The LAB provides space for long-term research and collaborative interdisciplinary learning.\n\nThe TALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE, is the culmination of years of conceptualising and dreaming of a way to bring material Objects closer to those they intimately impact. It has been developed by the TALKING OBJECTS LAB, African Digital Heritage (Nairobi), Visual Intelligence, and a variety of thinkers and artists experimenting with text, images, audio, and video, to create their own cosmologies of Objects in the digital space."},"id":"eb8239c1-953e-4817-8778-a35cff35f4e1","isHidden":false,"type":"obj"},{"content":{"about_box_title":"What we do ","about_box_text":"‘We’, the collective that developed the TALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE, individually and together, create projects that break colonial thought patterns, challenge eurocentric views, and foster decolonial curatorial and artistic practices.\n\nFor the TALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE we are fanning out a polyphonic (interrelated) universe of knowledge starting with Objects from various Museums. Using these Objects as well as diverse lived and un/imaginable experiences, we have constructed an ever evolving digital platform for memory and archival practice that centres indigenous people, indigenous epistemologies, and those who “still struggle to write the genealogies of their people and keep historical/ancestral consciousness alive”- Neo Musangi, TALKING OBJECTS LAB \"Imagining a digital archive for decolonial knowledge production Workshop\" on the 11th of January 2022."},"id":"d2282fa6-bd92-470c-b939-8c6b55140437","isHidden":false,"type":"obj"},{"content":{"about_box_title":"Why we do it","about_box_text":"New perspectives and questions are needed to break up the colonial thought patterns and eurocentric/white perspectives that continue to shape interactions and approaches to cultures and societies of the Global South.\n\nThe TALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE will be a digital platform that facilitates new narratives, epistemologies, and schools of thought. The Objects in the ARCHIVE will serve as door openers to what plural knowledge can be today. Through this curated collection – compiled from varied museum collections – poly-perspectival narratives will fan out around the selected Objects, and avenues for exploration and experimentation will spring forth."},"id":"385dcfd7-95f8-428d-9f25-c0f5801f152b","isHidden":false,"type":"obj"},{"content":{"about_box_title":"How we do it","about_box_text":"We practise **'epistemic disobedience'** that reframes the principles on which knowledge is built, disciplines formed, and intellectual discourse based. We untie, delink, and de-privilege the Western canon by not only dislodging dominant Western knowledge models but also intentionally centering indigenous knowledge systems. We embrace the beauty in subjectivity and allow different truths to stand side by side.\n\nThis is why we work with a variety of collaborating organisations, researchers, and cultural practitioners from various fields. The Objects gathered for the ARCHIVE and brought into new relationships come from the collections of the Musée Theodor Monod (Dakar), the Grassi Museum (Leipzig), the Rautenstrauch Joest Museum (Cologne), the Museum Angewandte Kunst,/Museum of Applied Arts (Frankfurt) and the Museum of European Cultures (Berlin).\n\nFor us, rethinking the production and transmission of knowledge means creating new relationships and references. This is reflected in the compilation of the TALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE collection of nearly 150 Objects. Of these, 50 come from the collection of the Musée Theodor Monod, Dakar. The rest are from the participating museums in Germany that were asked to respond to the Musée Theodor Monod's selection with Objects from their own collections. The result is a combined collection of Objects in conversation with one another.\n\nWe also investigate knowledge systems in music, collect oral history, and invite young people to make simple accessible films and authors to write prose and poetry. In short, we create a cosmos of diverse knowledge around Objects. We do this by continuously inviting contributors i.e. artists, researchers, and culture workers to engage with the individual Objects and the knowledge contained in them from their own unique and subjective perspectives. This has brought about inspiring work in text, film, and audio."},"id":"18cbdf5c-c2b2-4806-8720-b5f2872856a9","isHidden":false,"type":"obj"},{"content":{"about_box_title":"About the future","about_box_text":"The TALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE seeks to break eurocentric knowledge systems and create a framework for visualising polyperspectivity- by making the interlinked body of knowledge around the archive’s Objects visible and accessible.\n\nThe digital ARCHIVE will continuously grow by drawing audiences in and allowing them to engage and contribute in creative, unique, meaningful, or even frivolous ways- in an attempt to challenge eurocentric knowledge systems. It will remain a vibrant collection fuelled by associative approaches and new narratives.\n\nTo foster this there will be a second phase via open calls to invite the youth as well as cultural practitioners to work with the archive.\n\nTALKING OBJECTS ARCHIVE will remain open to the public and is aimed at researchers and practitioners working in the arts and those interested in decolonial perspectives on knowledge production."},"id":"bc9e4370-9b34-4d47-a7b9-fce0dc354007","isHidden":false,"type":"obj"}]
